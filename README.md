# R3Dki-Makes-Code
Everyone can commit and propose ideas that they think should be a program and if possible i'll code an app for that.
#
#
You can tell me if you want an application in a specific language by typing in the name of it after writing what the program should do.
#
You can choose between these languages:
C# - C++ - Java - Javascript
#
You can select if you want a GUI or CLI application by typing in GUI or CLI after the language of choice.
#
Examples:
Show a window - Java - GUI
Close a process - C++ - CLI
Make the console say "ur mom" - C# - CLI
Make a Dear ImGui clone - JavaScript - GUI
